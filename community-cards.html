    <h2>COMMUNITY CARDS</h2>
    <h3>Omaha (a.k.a. Oma-Hi)</h3>
    <p class="wild">
      Cards in hand: 4<br />
      Community cards: 5<br />
      Wild cards: none
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> Winning hand combination must include exactly
      2 from the hand, 3 from the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four cards dealt to each player. Five community cards, Texas Hold ‘Em
      style: “The Flop” (3 cards); “The Turn” (1 card); “The River” (1 card).
    </p>
    <p>Showdown: best five-card hand (2 in hand, 3 on board) wins pot.</p>

    <h3>Omaha Hi-Lo</h3>
    <p class="wild">
      Cards in hand: 4<br />
      Community cards: 5<br />
      Wild cards: none
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> Winning hand combination must include exactly
      2 from the hand, 3 from the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four cards dealt to each player. Five community cards, Texas Hold ‘Em
      style: “The Flop” (3 cards); “The Turn” (1 card); “The River” (1 card).
    </p>
    <p>
      Showdown: Make your best five-card hand (2 in hand, 3 on board). High hand
      wins 50% of pot. Low hand (8-high or lower) takes remaining 50%. (High
      hand takes extra chip if uneven pot; winner can choose to leave chip in as
      extra ante.) If no low hand (8-high or lower), high hand takes entire pot.
      Same player can win high and low, as players can use different cards for
      each scenario.
    </p>

    <h3>Council Bluffs</h3>
    <p>
      Same game as Omaha Hi-Lo, with the following exception: The fifth
      community card (“the River”) sets the high-low qualifier (which is
      normally 8).
    </p>

    <h3>Iron Cross</h3>
    <p class="wild">
      Cards in hand: 4<br />
      Community cards: 5 (shaped in a cross)<br />
      Wild cards: typically none; on occasion, dealer will call the center card
      in the cross as wild
    </p>
    <p>
      Four cards dealt to each player, and five cards arranged in a cross
      pattern face-down on table. Round of betting. Flip two outer cross cards,
      one on each axis. Round of betting. Flip remaining two outer cards. Round
      of betting. Flip center card. Round of betting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Showdown: Make the best five-card hand, using only cards in hand and the
      vertical or horizontal arrangement of cross cards. Player can use 2 to 4
      cards from the hand.
    </p>

    <h3>Elevator</h3>
    <p class="wild">
      Cards in hand: 4<br />
      Community cards: 7 (arranged in an H: columns of 3, 1, and 3)<br />
      Wild cards: none
    </p>
    <p>
      Four cards dealt to each player, and seven in an H formation in the middle
      of the table. Do four rounds of the Dealer revealing cards (opposite
      corners from “walls,” opposite corners from “walls,” middle cards from
      “walls,” the “elevator car”).
    </p>
    <p>
      Showdown: Best five-card hand using 2-4 cards in your hand and 1-3 cards
      from one row of the elevator. The "elevator car" can be used in
      combination with any of the pairs surrounding it—that is, it can move up
      and down the H.
    </p>

    <h3>Double Board Hold ’Em</h3>
    <p class="wild">
      Cards in hand: 2<br />
      Community cards: 10 (2 rows of 5)<br />
      Wild cards: none
    </p>
    <p>It’s Texas Hold ‘Em, but with two flops.</p>
    <p>
      Showdown: Best hand using top row of community cards takes half the pot.
      Best hand using bottom row of community cards takes the other half of the
      pot.
    </p>

    <h3>Alaska Hold Em</h3>
    <p class="wild">
      Cards in hand: 3 (pre-flop); 2 (post-flop)<br />
      Community cards: 6 (but discarded down to 5 for Showdown)<br />
      Wild cards: none
    </p>
    <p>
      Deal three cards to each player initially; discard one after the flop. An
      additional card, the Avalanche, is dealt after the River -- at this point,
      the lowest showing rank on the table (which may be the Avalanche) is
      discarded.
    </p>
    <p>Showdown: best five-card hand, any combo of hole/community cards.</p>
