    <title>CR Poker Guys: Five Card Draw</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>FIVE CARD DRAW</h2>
<h3>Jacks or Better, Trips to Win</h3>
<p class="wild">Wild cards: none</p>
<p>Five cards dealt to each player. To make an opening bet, player must have at least a pair of Jacks or better. Once an opening bet has been made, any player can call/raise the bet. Draw up to 3 cards (or 4 with an Ace). Betting phase follows. If all players check, the players re-ante and a new hand is played. If a bet is made and a player folds, that player is out of the game permanently.</p> 
<p>Showdown: If a bet was made, all remaining players show their hands. A winning hand must be three of a kind or better to take the pot. If no hands reach this threshold, the remaining players re-ante and a new hand is played.</p>

<h3>Beat the Daryl</h3>

<p class="wild">Wild cards: none</p>
<p>Five cards dealt to each player. Draw phase: Discard up to 3 (or 4 with an Ace). Betting phase follows; anyone who folds leaves the game permanently.</p>
<p>Showdown: Determine which player has the best five-card hand. Then, gather up all discards from the draw phase, and form “the Daryl’s” best five-card hand. If the top player beats the Daryl, he takes the pot. If Daryl wins, all players who remained in the hand re-ante, and another hand is dealt.</p>

<h3>Fours, Whores, and ’Staches</h3>
<p class="wild">Wild cards: 4s, Queens, Jacks and Kings with mustaches</p>
<p>Five cards dealt to each player. Due to number of wild cards, this game might be better played as a Five Card Stud, or with a limited draw phase (maximum 2 cards).</p>
