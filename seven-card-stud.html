    <title>CR Poker Guys: Seven Card Stud</title>
  </head>

    <h2>SEVEN-CARD STUD</h2>
    <h3>Sequence</h3>
    <p class="wild">Wild cards: evolves throughout the hand</p>
    <p>
      Seven-card stud. Once a 2 enters the game face-up, 2s become wild. If a 3
      is turned up after 2s become wild, then 3s become wild. And so on. Wild
      designation locks in after final up card has been dealt.
    </p>
    <p>Showdown: Best five cards.</p>

    <h3>Follow the Queen (a.k.a. Follow the Bitch)</h3>
    <p class="wild">Wild cards: evolves throughout the hand</p>
    <p>
      Seven-card stud. Once a Queen enters the game face-up, the next card dealt
      determines the wild. (Number or face, not suit.) Subsequent Queens reset
      wipe out the previous wild value. If a Queen is the last face-up card,
      there is no wild card.
    </p>
    <p>Showdown: best five-card hand.</p>

    <h3>Daddy’s Home (a.k.a. Smack My Bitch Up)</h3>
    <p class="wild">Wild cards: evolves throughout the hand</p>
    <p>
      Same game as Follow the Queen, with this exception: if a wild card has
      been determined, and a King enters the game face-up, the wild designation
      is wiped out.
    </p>

    <h3>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</h3>
    <p class="wild">Wild cards: established by “The Good”</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> the Good, Bad, and Ugly cards are not
      community cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven-card stud. Deal two down cards and one up card to each player, and
      place three cards face-down in the middle of the table. Bet. Deal second
      up card, and flip one of the central cards. This is “The Good”: all cards
      of this number/face are wild. Bet. Deal third up card. Flip a second
      central card. This is “The Bad”: players must discard this number/face
      from their hand or from their up cards. Bet. Deal fourth up card. Flip
      final central card. This is “The Ugly”: if a player has this number/face
      among their up cards, that player must fold. Bet.
    </p>
    <p>Showdown: best five-card hand.</p>

    <h3>Chicago</h3>
    <p class="wild">
      Wild cards: none<br />
      Special card: lowest spade in the hole
    </p>
    <p>
      Showdown: best five-card hand. High hand takes half the pot. The lowest
      spade in the hole takes half the pot. If no spades in the hole, high hand
      takes the entire pot.
    </p>

    <h3>Baseball: The Backward K</h3>
    <p class="wild">
      Wild cards: 9<br />
      Special cards: 7 (as an up card), 3 (as an up card)
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven-card stud. 9s wild. The seventh-inning stretch: if you get a 7 as an
      up card, you get a free card that round (given after all players have
      received their up card). Strikeout: if you get a 3 as an up card, you’ve
      gone down looking—automatic fold.
    </p>
    <p>Showdown: best five-card hand.</p>

    <h3>Red and Black</h3>
    <p class="wild">Wild cards: none</p>
    <p>
      Simple addition game. Black cards worth 0. Red cards worth face value with
      exception of Aces, which are 15.
    </p>
    <p>Showdown: High/low hands split the pot.</p>

    <h3>Deuces, Jacks, and the Man with the Axe</h3>
    <p class="wild">
      Wild cards: Deuces, Jacks, and the King of Diamonds<br />
      Special cards: pair of natural 7s
    </p>
    <p>Showdown: The hand that beats all hands: a pair of natural sevens.</p>

    <h3>Marilyn Monroe</h3>
    <p class="wild">
      Wild cards: none<br />
      Special cards: non-face card Diamonds
    </p>
    <p>
      Showdown: High hand splits with the largest number of diamond pips. Face
      cards do not have any pips.
    </p>

    <h3>Sidewinder</h3>
    <p class="wild">Wild cards: none</p>
    <p>Deal two cards down to each player (as usual for Seven Stud).</p>
    <p>
      Then do the four usual Seven Stud face-up rounds, except that: each player
      gets a card dealt face-down, then each player passes a face-down card to
      the left, then each reveals a card.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final card is passed, but not revealed, so you wind up with four up,
      three down, like Seven Stud.
    </p>
    <p>Showdown: best five-card hand.</p>

    <h3>Liege Lord</h3>
    <p class="wild">Wild cards: none</p>
    <p>
      Same game as Sidewinder, except the winner splits with the remaining
      player to his right (the one who was passing to him).
    </p>

    <h3>Schroedinger’s Card</h3>
    <p class="wild">
      Wild cards: none<br />
      Special card: fifth card (dealt as a common card; becomes the high/low
      pivot)
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven-card stud. Instead of dealing a fifth card to each player (what
      would normally be the third face-up card), it is revealed as a common card
      for the entire table. That rank is now "high", and the number just above
      it is now the "low."
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: common card is a 9—now a high straight is 9-8-7-6-5, and 10s are
      now the low card. To make this work, Aces are "round the corner," so a
      straight can pass through the Ace. (That is, 3-2-A-K-Q is a legal
      straight.)
    </p>
    <p>Showdown: best five-card hand.</p>

    <h3>My Own Private Omaha</h3>
    <p class="wild">Wild cards: none</p>
    <p>Seven-card stud, but 2 down/3 up/2 down.</p>
    <p>
      Showdown: Best five-card hand. Player uses his three up cards and two of
      his four down cards.
    </p>

    <h2>SEVEN CARD (SPECIAL)</h2>
    <h3>Midnight Baseball</h3>
    <p class="wild">
      Wild cards: 3s, 9s<br />
      Special cards: If you turn a 4, you can buy a card for 2x the ante
    </p>
    <p>
      Dealer provides each player with seven cards; players cannot look at their
      cards. Dealer flips top card from deck. Player to left must beat the
      flipped card. Once the active player has the high hand, that player bets,
      and play passes to the left. If player cannot beat the high hand, the
      remaining player to the right starts the bet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Showdown: Game ends when last card is flipped or only one player remains
      in the game.
