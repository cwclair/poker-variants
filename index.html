<h2>FIVE CARD DRAW</h2>
<h3>Jacks or Better, Trips to Win</h3>
<p>Wild cards: none</p>
<p>Five cards dealt to each player. To make an opening bet, player must have at least a pair of Jacks or better. Once an opening bet has been made, any player can call/raise the bet. Draw up to 3 cards (or 4 with an Ace). Betting phase follows. If all players check, the players re-ante and a new hand is played. If a bet is made and a player folds, that player is out of the game permanently.</p> 
<p>Showdown: If a bet was made, all remaining players show their hands. A winning hand must be three of a kind or better to take the pot. If no hands reach this threshold, the remaining players re-ante and a new hand is played.</p>

<h3>Beat the Daryl</h3>

<p>Wild cards: none</p>
<p>Five cards dealt to each player. Draw phase: Discard up to 3 (or 4 with an Ace). Betting phase follows; anyone who folds leaves the game permanently.</p>
<p>Showdown: Determine which player has the best five-card hand. Then, gather up all discards from the draw phase, and form “the Daryl’s” best five-card hand. If the top player beats the Daryl, he takes the pot. If Daryl wins, all players who remained in the hand re-ante, and another hand is dealt.</p>

<h3>Fours, Whores, and ’Staches</h3>
<p>Wild cards: 4s, Queens, Jacks and Kings with mustaches</p>
<p>Five cards dealt to each player. Due to number of wild cards, this game might be better played as a Five Card Stud, or with a limited draw phase (maximum 2 cards).</p>

<h2>COMMUNITY CARDS</h2>
<h3>Omaha (a.k.a. Oma-Hi)</h3>
<p>Cards in hand: 4</p>
<p>Community cards: 5</p>
<p>Wild cards: none</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Winning hand combination must include exactly 2 from the hand, 3 from the board.</p>
<p>Four cards dealt to each player. Five community cards, Texas Hold ‘Em style: “The Flop” (3 cards); “The Turn” (1 card); “The River” (1 card).</p>
<p>Showdown: best five-card hand (2 in hand, 3 on board) wins pot.</p>

<h3>Omaha Hi-Lo</h3>
<p>Cards in hand: 4</p>
<p>Community cards: 5</p>
<p>Wild cards: none</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Winning hand combination must include exactly 2 from the hand, 3 from the board.</p>
<p>Four cards dealt to each player. Five community cards, Texas Hold ‘Em style: “The Flop” (3 cards); “The Turn” (1 card); “The River” (1 card).</p>
<p>Showdown: Make your best five-card hand (2 in hand, 3 on board). High hand wins 50% of pot. Low hand (8-high or lower) takes remaining 50%. (High hand takes extra chip if uneven pot; winner can choose to leave chip in as extra ante.) If no low hand (8-high or lower), high hand takes entire pot. Same player can win high and low, as players can use different cards for each scenario.</p>

<h3>Council Bluffs</h3>
<p>Same game as Omaha Hi-Lo, with the following exception: The fifth community card (“the River”) sets the high-low qualifier (which is normally 8).</p>

<h3>Iron Cross</h3>
<p>Cards in hand: 4</p>
<p>Community cards: 5 (shaped in a cross)</p>
<p>Wild cards: typically none; on occasion, dealer will call the center card in the cross as wild</p>

<p>Wild cards: none</p>
<p>Four cards dealt to each player, and seven in an H formation in the middle of the table. Do four rounds of the Dealer revealing cards (opposite corners from “walls,” opposite corners from “walls,” middle cards from “walls,” the “elevator car”).</p>
<p>Showdown: Best five-card hand using 2-4 cards in your hand and 1-3 cards from one row of the elevator. The "elevator car" can be used in combination with any of the pairs surrounding it—that is, it can move up and down the H.</p>

<h3>Double Board Hold ’Em</h3>
<p>Cards in hand: 2</p>
<p>Community cards: 10 (2 rows of 5)</p>
<p>Wild cards: none</p>
<p>It’s Texas Hold ‘Em, but with two flops.</p>
<p>Showdown: Best hand using top row of community cards takes half the pot. Best hand using bottom row of community cards takes the other half of the pot.</p>

<p>Showdown: best five-card hand, any combo of hole/community cards.</p>

<h2>SEVEN-CARD STUD</h2>
<h3>Sequence</h3>
<p>Wild cards: evolves throughout the hand</p>
<p>Seven-card stud. Once a 2 enters the game face-up, 2s become wild. If a 3 is turned up after 2s become wild, then 3s become wild. And so on. Wild designation locks in after final up card has been dealt.</p>
<p>Showdown: Best five cards.</p>

<h3>Follow the Queen (a.k.a. Follow the Bitch)</h3>
<p>Wild cards: evolves throughout the hand</p>
<p>Seven-card stud. Once a Queen enters the game face-up, the next card dealt determines the wild. (Number or face, not suit.) Subsequent Queens reset wipe out the previous wild value. If a Queen is the last face-up card, there is no wild card.</p>
<p>Showdown: best five-card hand.</p>

<h3>Daddy’s Home (a.k.a. Smack My Bitch Up)</h3>
<p>Wild cards: evolves throughout the hand</p>
<p>Same game as Follow the Queen, with this exception: if a wild card has been determined, and a King enters the game face-up, the wild designation is wiped out.</p>

<h3>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</h3>
<p>Wild cards: established by “The Good”</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> the Good, Bad, and Ugly cards are not community cards.</p>
<p>Seven-card stud. Deal two down cards and one up card to each player, and place three cards face-down in the middle of the table. Bet. Deal second up card, and flip one of the central cards. This is “The Good”: all cards of this number/face are wild. Bet. Deal third up card. Flip a second central card. This is “The Bad”: players must discard this number/face from their hand or from their up cards. Bet. Deal fourth up card. Flip final central card. This is “The Ugly”: if a player has this number/face among their up cards, that player must fold. Bet.</p>
<p>Showdown: best five-card hand.</p>

<h3>Chicago</h3>
<p>Wild cards: none</p>
<p>Special card: lowest spade in the hole</p>
<p>Showdown: best five-card hand. High hand takes half the pot. The lowest spade in the hole takes half the pot. If no spades in the hole, high hand takes the entire pot.</p>

<h3>Baseball: The Backward K</h3>
<p>Wild cards: 9</p>
<p>Special cards: 7 (as an up card), 3 (as an up card)</p>
<p>Seven-card stud. 9s wild. The seventh-inning stretch: if you get a 7 as an up card, you get a free card that round (given after all players have received their up card). Strikeout: if you get a 3 as an up card, you’ve gone down looking—automatic fold.</p>
<p>Showdown: best five-card hand.</p>

<h3>Red and Black</h3>
<p>Wild cards: none</p>
<p>Simple addition game. Black cards worth 0. Red cards worth face value with exception of Aces, which are 15.</p>
<p>Showdown: High/low hands split the pot.</p>

<h3>Aces, Jacks, and the Man with the Axe</h3>
<p>Wild cards: Aces, Jacks, and the King of Diamonds</p>
<p>Special cards: pair of natural 7s</p>
<p>Showdown: The hand that beats all hands: a pair of natural sevens.</p>

<h3>Marilyn Monroe</h3>
<p>Wild cards: none</p>
<p>Special cards: non-face card Diamonds</p>
<p>Showdown: High hand splits with the largest number of diamond pips. Face cards do not have any pips.</p>

<h3>Sidewinder</h3>
<p>Wild cards: none</p>
<p>Deal two cards down to each player (as usual for Seven Stud).</p>
<p>Then do the four usual Seven Stud face-up rounds, except that: each player gets a card dealt face-down, then each player passes a face-down card to the left, then each reveals a card.</p>
<p>The final card is passed, but not revealed, so you wind up with four up, three down, like Seven Stud.</p>
<p>Showdown: best five-card hand.</p>

<h3>Liege Lord</h3>
<p>Wild cards: none</p>
<p>Same game as Sidewinder, except the winner splits with the remaining player to his right (the one who was passing to him).</p>

<h3>Schroedinger’s Card</h3>
<p>Wild cards: none</p>
<p>Special card: fifth card (dealt as a common card; becomes the high/low pivot)</p>
<p>Seven-card stud. Instead of dealing a fifth card to each player (what would normally be the third face-up card), it is revealed as a common card for the entire table. That rank is now "high", and the number just above it is now the "low."</p>
<p>Example: common card is a 9—now a high straight is 9-8-7-6-5, and 10s are now the low card. To make this work, Aces are "round the corner," so a straight can pass through the Ace. (That is, 3-2-A-K-Q is a legal straight.)</p>
<p>Showdown: best five-card hand.</p>

<h3>My Own Private Omaha</h3>
<p>Wild cards: none</p>
<p>Seven-card stud, but 2 down/3 up/2 down.</p>
<p>Showdown: Best five-card hand. Player uses his three up cards and two of his four down cards.</p>

<h2>SEVEN CARD (SPECIAL)</h2>
<h3>Midnight Baseball</h3>
<p>Wild cards: 3, 9</p>
<p>Special cards: If you turn a 4, you can buy a card for 2x the ante</p>
<p>Dealer provides each player with seven cards; players cannot look at their cards. Dealer flips top card from deck. Player to left must beat the flipped card. Once the active player has the high hand, that player bets, and play passes to the left. If player cannot beat the high hand, the remaining player to the right starts the bet.</p>
<p>Showdown: Game ends when last card is flipped or only one player remains in the game.</p>
